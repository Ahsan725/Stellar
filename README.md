## Overview

### Description

**Description**: FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) Stellar is a financial planning app aimed at empowering users to make informed decisions about their finances and work towards early retirement. It offers insights and tips on optimizing spending habits, investing wisely, and building passive income streams to accelerate wealth accumulation.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Financial Education
- **Mobile:** A website needs to be visited and looked at whereas an App can be handy to look at. It is also good to ask quick questions to see if doing a certain action will de-track you from your FIRE trajectory. 
- **Story:** The story is incredibly compelling as it revolves around having an assistant or friend looking out for you and your financial independence, someone you can ask and consult before taking action.  
- **Market:** The market for financial apps is limited to budget-tracking apps. This one is based on your FIRE journey looking at the big picture without getting tied up in the tedious budget tracking. Based on the principle that 80% of the results come from 20% of the key actions.
- **Habit:** It is a habit forming because it gamifies financial independence. The users can check on the app if they are still on track to retire and by when or if making reckless decisions has cost them to work more years before they can retire, etc.
- **Scope:** A stripped-down bare-bones version of this app will also be interesting primarily because it is built around the idea of solving a problem in a simple yet effective way.
